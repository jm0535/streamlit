2. **Use Appropriate Tuning**: Choose tuning system that matches the music
3. **Consider Recording Quality**: Adjust settings for clean vs. field recordings
4. **Apply Scale Constraints**: When studying specific traditions, constrain notes to relevant scales
5. **Check Confidence Scores**: Review which notes were detected with high vs. low confidence
6. **Document Your Research**: Keep detailed notes for reproducibility and future reference
7. **Backup Your Data**: Regular backups prevent data loss
